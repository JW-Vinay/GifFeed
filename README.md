GifFeed

An application that allows you to create GIF based feeds and publish around.

Traditional advertising formats on mobile devices suffer from poor click through rates and are considered to be invasive and non-intuitive for the end user. At present, industry experts are advocating a new advertising format called Native Ads. However, there isnâ€™t sufficient metric to validate the effectiveness of this new advertising format. 

GifFeed app will be used to evaluate the implementation of Native Ads against traditionals Ads (Banners) as well as analyse the performance of both these formats. GifFeed is available in the Google Play Store as an Entertainment app. We will use advertising SDKs from two popular advertising platforms, Facebook and Yahoo.
